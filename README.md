# Password-Checker-using-python-regex-
I built this for learning RegEx but both are legit and working.
# First Checker
First takes atleast 8 characters including any speacial characters.
# Second Checker
It also takes atleast 8 characters but in this the last character should be a number, I have done this just for a little more restriction.
